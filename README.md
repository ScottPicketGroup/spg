Running Issues:

Cookies banner/button missing. (Also see top left)

Mobile menu not matching design - also missing sub menu structure (see top left of design file)

Book a table slide out missing (See top left)

Menu animations missing (Though I have coded these out as above so dont stress about that) - Marek to finish 
  
Desktop - Left container should be 33% and right 66% to match design file.

Padding missing from bottom of pages 

Home page -
Missing bottom 4 'veunes' - these should be 'cards' as external link (Card including image and underneight text as surrounding div)
These cards have :hover states - please see design (right hand document that states what should happen on hover)

Scott Picket page -
Wrong image as hero 
Qoute text-align should be center 

Timeline - Left/Year section should be 25% of page or 37.5% of right contianer - Description should be or 41% of page or 62.5% of right contianer
Image should only appear on hover of the above timeline element and to all elements - please use this image for all elements at this stage. Image is also too big and doesnt match creative - should be 25% of page and centered in the left column container (33% width of page)
Margin on top of these elements between the Timeline intro text and the top of the first year element should be 2.25rem not 9.
Margin between these elements and the Accolades section is incorred - last child of timeline should have 2.25 - then either margin top on accolades or bottom on timeline should have 6rem - as per design.

The remaining sections should have the same container widths as the above section to match them
Lots of content missing
